/* 
A football competition has just finished. The players have been given points for scoring goals and points for committing fouls. Now, it is up to Alex to find the best player in the tournament. As a programmer, your job is to help Alex by telling him the highest number of points achieved by some player.

You are given two sequences A1,A2,…,AN and B1,B2,…,BN. For each valid i, player i scored Ai goals and committed Bi fouls. For each goal, the player that scored it gets 20 points, and for each foul, 10 points are deducted from the player that committed it. However, if the resulting number of points of some player is negative, this player will be considered to have 0 points instead.

You need to calculate the total number of points gained by each player and tell Alex the maximum of these values.

Example Input
2
3
40 30 50
2 4 20
1
0
10
Example Output
800
0
Explanation
Example case 1: The first player gets 800 points for scoring goals and has 20 points deducted for fouls. Likewise, the second player gets 560 points and the third player gets 800 points. The third player is the one with the maximum number of points.
